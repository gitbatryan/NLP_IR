# The modern and contemprorary great speech

I have chosen **"Famous speeches of notable people"** as the topic for my project. I am usually interested in the history of the world, and I enjoy listening to the stories of individuals who had big influene in history. I also aspire to captivate an audience when giving speeches or presentations, just as they did. By using an IR system to analyze common expressions, sentences, and words found in these famous speeches, I will be able to improve my ability to persuade and engage people through speaking.

Choosing this topic provides an additional benefit: it offers an opportunity to understand the thoughts and perspectives of historical figures from different eras.


This IR system dataset used speeches posted on the ['Top 100 speeches of the 20th century by rank'](https://www.americanrhetoric.com/top100speechesall.html) and ['the famous speeches'](https://www.famous-speeches-and-speech-topics.info/famous-speeches/).
